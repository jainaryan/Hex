# Hex
This project is an implementation of the Hex game in using C++.
Simply set the main argument in the compiler to get a n*n board (where n is a number of your choice). The user is named player "0" and the computer player "1".
The user tries to create a path across the board whereas the computer tries to create a path from top to bottom.
